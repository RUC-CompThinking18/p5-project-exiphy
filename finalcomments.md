# Interactivity
Using P5.dom to interact with the user was a great idea hereâ€”and great practice if you want to take input on the web. The interaction wasn't extensive, but it did give clear and immediate feedback.

# Code Quality
The code was clean, and you used the P5.dom library well in conjunction with the P5 functions we talked about in class. I would have liked to have seen a great deal more comments, however.

# Aesthetics
This is a fun use of the P5 libraries. There's not a lot of heft behind its ideas, but you did well with it in a short amount of time.
